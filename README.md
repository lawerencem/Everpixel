# Everpixel (Code-Name)

# Overview
   This is a game that I have been making during my free time.  Please feel free to peruse the code/images/resources - but please do not use or redistribute the code without my explicit permission.
   
   I intend for this game to be free and available for download when I finish it.
   
# Motivation
   I like video games, but I am finding it harder and harder to find a game that I enjoy.  I also enjoy programming.  So, I wanted to combine the two and make a game that I enjoy playing.

# About the Game
  Ever heard of a wereslug?  Or a warween?  This game has those.  And fatalities.  Welcome to an over-the-top tactical roguelike hex-based RPG. Eclectically inspired by Battle Brothers, Baldur's Gate, Super Mario, Mortal Kombat, 80's action movies, and dinosaurs that wear tutus.
