# Furniture Faction

## Background

The furniture faction spawned from a moment of sheer genius or ineptitude, depending upon your view.  In a bid to overthrow a kingdom that had used his services and vilified him to avoid payment, Chauncy Buttertoes, the last in a long line of Buttertoes who were known for their adept necromancy skills and soft feet, did the unthinkable.  He surmised that a direct assault of skeletons and various undead constructs on the kingdom would fail.  They were simply too prone to raising alarms and putting folks on edge.  No, that would never work.  Chauncy would need a force that no-one would see coming.

To that end, he applied his necromantic abilities to inanimate objects, not just the normal bits of bone and dead flesh, but things that had never been animate.  He struggled for years with spoons and cutlery and pained himself to coax a hairpin to move more than an inch of its own accord.  One night, in a fit of desperation, he tried to animate a simple stone in a random dark alley of the kingdom’s red light district.  Unfortunately, that alley opened to the rear of a geomancy college.  They spotted his efforts, mocked him viciously, and ran him out of town quite roughly.  During the ordeal he had blacked out.   In the morning, he awoke to notice but three things:  various aches and pains, a strong urge to find a chamber pot, and note in his pocket that said simply, “Move this stone.”

After that, he fell to his cups, stumbling from one town to another, animating  barnyard animals for distraught farmers and his own needs for companionship.  At his lowest point, he found himself drunk and disheveled, staring at bits of horse and goat on the floor of an old stable.  Through the drink and tears of shame, he cast his spell awry.  Instead of some horrific new horse-goat companion, the corner piss bucket wobbled itself before him and spilled its contents in greeting.

After a fashion, his surprise and stupor gave way to excitement and confusion.  Why, of all things, did this simple bucket, this wooden bucket, come to life?  Chauncy would not be the Buttertoes who lost his edge!  No, he had stumbled onto something important.  We will spare you the next bit of the story, for it is filled with disturbing bits of experimentation and self discovery. Ultimately, he realized that wooden objects animated because they came from something that once lived. Plant and tree materials had just enough of life’s essence for Chauncy to awaken.

At long last, a plan for revenge was possible.  He would raze the kingdom that wronged him by casting the largest animation spell ever conceived.  In the dead of night, he would awaken all the furniture.  Dressers would topple upon their owners on his command.  Beds would shimmy to the nearest window and dump their owners to the streets below. Butter churns would impale any survivors and circle the King’s castle with their cargo on display.  They shall serve as an example to others.

Tragically, Chauncy overexerted himself when it was time to execute his plan.  Too much power and impatience become his downfall.  After the spell took effect, he managed but one visceral command, “Destroy!”  then collapsed before he could limit the magic.  The ensuing carnage took the life of every man, woman, and child.  For a time afterwards, no visitor who entered the kingdom could understand what had happened.  The furniture lay dormant.  That ended when they began to hunger.
