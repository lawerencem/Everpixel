FIX BUGS IN PARTY LOADER (culture isnt a key - only party name...)

- Weekend Duties
  -- Fire Fatality
  -- Complete more abilities
	--- Wereween
	--- Howl
	--- LEap
  -- Change AP to base 10
  -- Dead eyes on critters

- Tidy up pixels on samurai armor and helms
- Next Weekend
  -- Refactor party/army system
   --- Cultures define individual units
   --- Subparty defines clusters (e.g., infantry slimers)
     ---- Difficulty needs to scale better (i.e., dont' start at 1 - start at 6?)
   --- Parties comprised of subparties with difficulty ratios
     ---- Allows feeding a number to a party that it scales well

- Combat logic
	- Bonuses to Hit when surrounding
	- Height bonuses / penalties
