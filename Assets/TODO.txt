TODO

1) - Dual-Wield
1.5) - Dead characters on tiles shouldn't prevent movement
3) - Critter classes / abilities during level up on the xml
5) - Calculate "height diff" when going from one height to another in hexes
6) - Force A* to directional search after so many nodes

Long Term: 
	Replace eyes with dead eyes when killed
	Zone of Control

Bugs:
can target killed characters?
Blocked damage shows -10?
Traversal still sometimes takes too much?
