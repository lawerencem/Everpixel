TODO

 - Add Zones traveling with the caster (i.e., a new type) such that spear wall travels with the caster
 - Remove particles on death

 BUGS
 - ween burster doesn't flip 180 on RTEAM
 - All of the crushed injuries are missing
 - Zones don't delete on char death
 - double hits (like double zone spear wall) cause flinches to remain after hit. 
   -- This is due to SFlinch grabbing current sprite from object rather than a guaranteed default sprite. IE., it can grab a flinch sprite instead of intended sprite.
