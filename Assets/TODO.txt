TODO

 - Add Zones traveling with the caster (i.e., a new type) such that spear wall travels with the caster
 - Finish up Spear wall 
   -- Ensure hit targets go back a square
   -- Implement a way to ensure bob doesn't happen.
 - Ensure Moving into a tile is called back to before moving to next tile (to prevent moving through spear wall zones)
