 BUGS
 - % chance to hit are jacked
  -- add ability to see hit chance for bullets
 - Crits don't display
 - ween burster doesn't flip 180 on RTEAM
 - double hits (like double zone spear wall) cause flinches to remain after hit. 
   -- This is due to SFlinch grabbing current sprite from object rather than a guaranteed default sprite. IE., it can grab a flinch sprite instead of intended sprite.
