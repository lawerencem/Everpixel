TODO

 - Multiple dodge on Area Suppress and Spear Wall is breaking
   -- IE, when a character has both a hit and dodge from two sources, eventing is jacked
   -- same with attacks of opportunity
   -- same with spear wall

 - Add Zones traveling with the caster (i.e., a new type) such that spear wall travels with the caster
 - Updaet main stat box on moves / events
 - Remove chars being in liquid layers
 - add feedback on not enough stamina
 - Implement ammo requirements
 - Ensure attacks of opportunity created on char creation

 BUGS
 - ween burster doesn't flip 180 on RTEAM
 - All of the crushed injuries are missing
 - double hits (like double zone spear wall) cause flinches to remain after hit. 
   -- This is due to SFlinch grabbing current sprite from object rather than a guaranteed default sprite. IE., it can grab a flinch sprite instead of intended sprite.
